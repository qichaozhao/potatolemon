# potatolemon

A neural network library for learning purposes.

## Aim

This library is a basic neural network library written from scratch in Python, optimised for code readability and understandability over performance. Although it will be dog slow and probably full of bugs, it should be an invaluable learning exercise.

This was very much inspired by taking Andrew Ng's Deep Learning Specialisation Course: [www.deeplearning.ai](www.deeplearning.ai)


##Â What's with the name?

potato - a very inefficient piece of electronics (although better known as a very tasty root vegetable).
lemon - a car that is prone to breaking down all the time.

It more or less describes the library :)
